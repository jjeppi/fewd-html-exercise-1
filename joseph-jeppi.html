  <p>IN <a href="http://danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/"> “CONTENT Display Patterns” </a> (which all front-end folk should read), Dan Mall points to a truth not unlike the one <a href="https://24ways.org/2015/putting-my-patterns-through-their-paces/"> Ethan Marcotte shared last month </a> on 24 ways. It is a truth as old as standards-based design: Construct your markup to properly support your content (not your design).</p>

  <p>Modular <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">/atomic design </a> doesn’t change this truth, it just reinforces its wisdom. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/"> Flexbox </a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/"> grid layout </a> don’t change this truth, they just make it easier to do it better. <a href="https://html5forwebdesigners.com/design/index.html"> HTML5 </a> doesn’t change this truth, it just reminds us that the separation of structure from style came into existence for a reason. A reason that hasn’t changed. A reason that cannot change, because it is the core truth of the web, and is inextricably bound up with the promise of this medium.</p>
